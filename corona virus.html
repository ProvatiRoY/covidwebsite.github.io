        <h1>COVID-19 INFO-STAY HOME,STAY SAFE</h1>
        <h2>#corona #coronavirus</h2>
        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
            Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without
            special treatment.</p>
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>Protect yourself and others around you by knowing the facts and taking appropriate precautions. Follow advice
            provided by your local health authority.
            To prevent the spread of COVID-19:
            Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
            Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
            Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.
            Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.
            Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
            Stay home if you feel unwell.
            If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention.
            Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This
            protects you, and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.
            Masks
            Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do
            not protect against COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the
            advice provided by your local health authority.</p>
        <h2>FAQ's(Frequently Asked Questions)</h2>
        <p><b>Q :</b>Can COVID-19 spread through food?</p>
        <p><b>Q :</b>It is highly unlikely that people can contract COVID-19 from food or food packaging. COVID-19 is a
            respiratory illness and the primary transmission route is through person-to- person contact and through
            direct contact with respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

            There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food
            packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply.</p>
        <p><b>Q :</b>Does drinking lots of water help flush out COVID-19?</p>
        <p><b>Ans: </b>PThere is no evidence that drinking lots of water flushes out the new coronavirus or the
            stomach acid kills the virus. However, for good health in general, it is recommended that
            people should have adequate water every day for good health and to prevent dehydration.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b>Which are the first symptoms of the coronavirus disease?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>The virus can cause a range of symptoms, ranging from mild illness to pneumonia. Symptoms of the
            disease are fever, cough, sore throat and headaches. In severe cases difficulty in breathing and deaths can
            occur</p>
        <p><b>Q :</b>Can asymptomatic patients transmit COVID-19?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>Available evidence from contact tracing reported by countries suggests that asymptomatically
            infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms.

            A subset of studies and data shared by some countries on detailed cluster investigations and contact tracing
            activities have reported that asymptomatically-infected individuals are much less likely to transmit the
            virus than those who develop symptoms.

            Comprehensive studies on transmission from asymptomatic patients are difficult to conduct, as they require
            testing of large population cohorts and more data are needed to better understand and quantified the
            transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. WHO is working with countries around the world, and global researchers, to
            gain better evidence-based understanding of the disease as a whole, including the role of asymptomatic
            patients in the transmission of the virus.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b>Is headache a symptom of the coronavirus disease?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>The virus can cause a range of symptoms, from ranging from mild illness to pneumonia. Symptoms of
            the disease are fever, cough, sore throat and headaches.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b>What is the recovery time for the coronavirus disease?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>Using available preliminary data, the median time from onset to clinical recovery for mild cases
            is approximately 2 weeks and is 3-6 weeks for patients with severe or critical disease.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b>Are smokers more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>Tobacco smokers (cigarettes, waterpipes, bidis, cigars, heated tobacco products) may be more
            vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, as the act of smoking involves contact of fingers (and possibly
            contaminated cigarettes) with the lips, which increases the possibility of transmission of viruses from hand
            to mouth.

            Smoking waterpipes, also known as shisha or hookah, often involves the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses,
            which could facilitate the transmission of the COVID-19 virus in communal and social settings.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b>How dangerous is COVID-19?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>Although for most people COVID-19 causes only mild illness, it can make some people very ill. More
            rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and those with pre- existing medical conditions (such as
            high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b>Can I catch coronavirus from the feces of someone with the disease?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While
            initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is
            not a main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to
            share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after
            using the bathroom and before eating.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b>What is the most common diagnosis for COVID-19 patients?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>The most common diagnosis in severe COVID-19 patients is severe pneumonia.</p>
        <p><b>Q:</b>Should coronavirus disease patients be isolated in hospitals?</p>
        <p><b>Ans:</b>WHO advises that all confirmed cases, even mild cases, should be isolated in health facilities, to
            prevent transmission and provide adequate care.

            But we recognize that many countries have already exceeded their capacity to care for mild cases in
            dedicated health facilities. In that situation, countries should prioritize older patients and those with
            underlying conditions.</p>
